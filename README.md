## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reubenjds/pokedex
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd pokedex
pnpm install
```

3. Build the project

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Hosting your own API

Optionally, you can choose to host your own API.

1. Install server dependencies

```bash
cd pokedex/server
pnpm install
```

2. In the server directory, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values

   For ease of use, [pokemon.json](https://github.com/reubenjds/pokedex/blob/main/scripts/pokemon.json) can be imported into MongoDB; name the collection 'generation1'.

3. Inside `pokemon/utils/client.ts` change `baseURL` to 'http://localhost:4040' (server is set to listen to port 4040 by default)

4. Start the server

```bash
pnpm devStart
```
